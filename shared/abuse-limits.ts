 * Abuse-prevention limits for outbound side effects.

 * Background: the org invitation system was abused to relay spam through our
 * email provider — an unverified account created throwaway organizations and
 * blasted invitations to unrelated addresses. These caps bound the blast radius
 * of any single account/organization on every endpoint that triggers outbound
 * email, independent of email verification (which proves mailbox ownership) and
 * plan-based business limits (which meter legitimate usage, not abuse).
 *
 * The numbers are deliberately generous for real recruiting teams and tight
 * enough that a hijacked or throwaway account cannot turn Kush Talents into a spam
 * relay. Tune here — every enforcement point imports these constants.
